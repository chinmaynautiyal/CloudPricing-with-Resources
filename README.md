# CloudPricing-with-Resources


Course Project as part of CS 594 Economics and Computation at UIC. 

Project examines cases with incoming jobs coming in with resource demands over available resources. Randomised experiments simulating the above case are examined for system characteristics such as welfare and revenue. 

The experiments indicate convergence of revenue and welfare over time, which might indicate at potential theoretical bounds.
